# CmdTimer

The Command Timer Application is a simple C++ program that allows you to execute a command from the command line and measures how long it takes for the command to complete. This can be useful for monitoring the execution time of various commands or scripts.

## Features

- Execute custom commands from the command line.
- Measure the execution time of the command.
- Display the execution time in seconds.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler:

   ```shell
   g++ -o command_timer command_timer.cpp

4. Run the compiled program by providing the command you want to time as an argument:

   ```shell
   ./command_timer [your_command_here]

5. The program will execute the command and display the time it took for the command to complete.

## Acknowledgments
- This project was inspired by the need to measure command execution times.
- Special thanks to the C++ community for providing the tools and resources necessary to create this simple utility.

Enjoy measuring the execution time of your commands!
